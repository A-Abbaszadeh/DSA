# Data Structures and Basics of Algorithms using C#

The course of data structure and algorithms is one of the most fundamental courses of many basic science and engineering courses, especially computer software engineering. The purpose of this course is to study and research various methods of storing, maintaining and retrieving information in a computer system so that this information can be used efficiently.

I wrote the codes of this repository at the same time as I passed **Data structures and basics of algorithms** course in Farsi taught by [Mr. Dr. Ali Sharifi-Zarchi](https://github.com/SharifiZarchi) in this **[link](https://mktb.me/8wjk)**. Dr. Sharifi did the implementations with **Python**, but I used **C#** and **.NET framework** to learn and practice C#.

#### My special thanks to the dear and honorable teacher, [Mr. Dr. Ali Sharifi-Zarchi](https://github.com/SharifiZarchi), and also to [Maktabkhooneh](https://maktabkhooneh.org/)
